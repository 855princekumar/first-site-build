# My First Web Development Project 

Welcome to my inaugural web development adventure!  This project marks my entry into the dynamic world of web development, and I'm thrilled to share it with you.

## Project Overview 

This repository showcases a basic website crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Dive into the code to explore how these languages come together, bringing life to a simple yet exciting web project.

## What's Inside? 

- **HTML:** Structure your content and build the foundation.
- **CSS:** Add style and aesthetics to enhance the visual experience.
- **JavaScript:** Inject dynamic behavior and interactivity into the project.

Feel free to take a peek, provide feedback, or share insights. As a 25-year-old on this coding journey, I'm eager to learn and improve.

## How to Get Started 

1. Clone the `gh-pages` branch to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone -b gh-pages --single-branch https://github.com/855princekumar/first-site-build.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to experience the magic.

## Locating Files in Different Branch 

If you're looking for files specific to a branch, navigate to the "Branch" tab on GitHub. There, you can switch between branches and explore the files associated with each branch.
